# MVC Calculator

This project was to create a basic calculator in java swing using the model-view-controller design. In this project, I utilized the state design pattern as well as the observer pattern. 

The calculator is represented by a gui. In addition, there is a server using sockets that will print valid equations passed by the client

## Running the program

To run the program, first run the server project. Then run the client project.

A calculator gui will appear.

The server will automatically print a list of all equations and the count as they are added.
